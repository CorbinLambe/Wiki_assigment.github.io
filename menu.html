            <h2> Video Games</h2>
            <p>The first thing you can do to upgrade your weekend is to play some relaxing video games. our first recondmendation is Little Big Planet a game made by Media Molucule in 2008 </p>

            <h2> Television Shows</h2>
            <p> Another thing you can do to improve your weekend is to watch some tv! Watching tv is a great way to relax and get immersed in a world that is different than our own</p>
            <p> We recommend wattching Supernatural, created by Eric Kripke in 2005. In order to watch the entirety of the show, it would take about 9 days without breaks.</p>
            <p> Supernatural will give you hours of fun content to watch as you follow the adventure of two brothers as the hunt evil and save as amny peolle as they can while travelling around the US.</p>
