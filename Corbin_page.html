            <h2>Community</h2>
            <p> Community was where anyone any where could play anything created by another user, some users created movies, others created levels and some players made music, by 2024 10 million level were created by users. User generated content was by far the biggest focal point for most players. User generated levels meant there was infinity replayability and it allowed players to get to know each other</p>

            <p> In little big planet there was a place called "your moon" in your moon you were able to create anything you wanted using the tools at your disposale and then publish it for players from across the world to play and comment about. A players moon was their profolio, a man had a players published levels and their drafts.</p>

            <p> The story of the first little Big Planet was 23 levels long and created by the developers of the game and was released with the launch of the game. it was mainly focused around platforming and collecting as many bubbles as you could, The game had bonus goals for after playing through the entire story, like trying to complete each level without dying or completing each level and getting every prize bubble. by doing these extra challenges players would be rewarded with extra material used to create appearances of the sack person or materials used to create levels on their moon. </p>

            <h2> The downfall of Little Big Planet</h2>
            <p> In April of 2024 Media Molucules parent company Sony unplugged little big planet servers with no warning to its players, 10 million levels published over 15 years were gone with in a second the community had been told that they unplugged the servers to the game because they were hacked and they didnt see the value of putting in the effort to fix it. as of today there has been no news of little big planet coming back, some community memebers have been trying to create a knock off for little big planet but no real time line of the games release has been revealed. With sony getting a new mascot found in astro bot, sack boy and the little big planet group has been forgoten and left to rot.</p>
