            <h2 id="downfall"> The downfall of Little Big Planet</h2>
            <p> In April of 2024 Media Molucules parent company Sony unplugged little big planet servers with no warning to its players, 10 million levels published over 15 years were gone with in a second the community had been told that they unplugged the servers to the game because they were hacked and they didnt see the value of putting in the effort to fix it. as of today there has been no news of little big planet coming back, some community memebers have been trying to create a knock off for little big planet but no real time line of the games release has been revealed. With sony getting a new mascot found in astro bot, sack boy and the little big planet group has been forgoten and left to rot.</p>
